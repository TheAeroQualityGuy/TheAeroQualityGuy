- 👋 Hi, I’m @TheAeroQualityGuy
- 👀 I’m interested in Aviation, engineering and Industry 4.0
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to code in numerous languages to create native desktop application 
- that could potentially solve everyday aerospace problems
- I feel there is a strong disconnect in effective software solutions in Aerospace.

Old softwares:
- 1. are slow and very data input heavy
- 2. have been sold to big international companieswho have withdrew some of the great features only to bring them back at a premium..

 New softwares:
- 1. designed solely by software development professionals who have little or no understanding of Aerospace
- 2. web-based....most aero companies dont want information on the cloud

my intention is to make softwares that will solely benefit Aerospace.
- Attract more people into my industry.
- Simplify internal processses making things more automated.


- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate....
